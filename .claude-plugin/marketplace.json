      "description": "Revolutionary four-tier agent architecture with 31 specialized agents, 23 skills, and 40 commands. NEW in v7.16.0: Enhanced design intelligence based on official Claude research on 'Improving frontend design through Skills' - implements distributional convergence awareness, altitude-appropriate guidance, high-impact motion principles, and comprehensive Framer Motion integration. v7.15.0: Comprehensive research capabilities across all domains with quality scoring (0-100), 5 research types, source credibility assessment, and citation management. Frontend design enhancement eliminates 'AI slop' aesthetics with distinctive typography (high-contrast pairings, extreme weight variations 100-200/800-900, 3x+ size jumps), intentional color schemes (avoiding purple-on-white defaults), and purposeful animations (one well-orchestrated page load > dozen random micro-animations). Features pattern learning that improves research and design choices, quality control, full-stack validation, intelligent automation, and 80-90% auto-fix success. Production ready with 60-70% token cost reduction, comprehensive quality improvement, and fully autonomous operation.",
