# Frontend Design Enhancement Command

Transform functional but generic frontend designs into distinctive, polished user experiences that avoid "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Workflow

1. **Design Audit**:
   - Identify current fonts, colors, backgrounds, animations
   - Calculate AI Slop Score (0-100)
   - Detect generic patterns (Inter fonts, purple gradients, plain backgrounds)

2. **Typography Enhancement**:
   - Select distinctive font pairings
   - Implement fluid typography
   - Establish clear hierarchy

3. **Color Scheme Design**:
   - Create intentional color palette with mood
   - Move beyond purple-on-white defaults
   - Ensure WCAG AA contrast compliance

4. **Background Treatment**:
   - Add layered depth (gradients, textures, patterns)
   - Avoid plain white/solid backgrounds

5. **Animation Implementation**:
   - Add page load animations
   - Implement micro-interactions
   - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

6. **Validation**:
   - Verify AI Slop Score improved (target < 30)
   - Check accessibility standards
   - Test responsive behavior

## Output

**Terminal (Concise)**:
```
[OK] Design enhanced successfully

AI Slop Score: 85 -> 15 (Improved by 70 points)

Improvements:
- Typography: Inter -> Playfair Display + Source Sans 3 (editorial)
- Colors: Purple gradient -> Ocean blue + amber (professional)
- Background: Plain white -> Layered gradient with subtle noise
- Animations: None -> Page transitions + micro-interactions

Files Modified: 4
Next Steps: Test responsive behavior, validate accessibility
Time: 12 minutes
```

**File (Comprehensive)**:
- Full design audit with before/after comparison
- Typography implementation details
- Color palette specifications
- Background CSS patterns
- Animation code examples
- Accessibility checklist
- Screenshots comparison (if available)

## Usage Examples

```
/design:enhance "Improve landing page aesthetics"
/design:enhance "Make dashboard look less generic"
/design:enhance "Apply professional design to React app"
```

## Success Criteria

- AI Slop Score reduced to < 30
- Distinctive fonts implemented (not Inter/Roboto)
- Intentional color scheme (not purple-on-white)
- Background has depth (not plain white)
- Animations present and purposeful
- WCAG AA contrast compliance
- Design pattern stored for learning
