# Organize Reports Command

## Command: `/workspace:reports`

Automated report organization and management system that categorizes, archives, and optimizes all validation, quality, and analysis reports with intelligent cleanup and searchable storage.

## How It Works

1. **Report Discovery**: Scans repository for all report files and analyzes content
2. **Intelligent Categorization**: Classifies reports by type, importance, and relevance
3. **Organized Storage**: Moves reports to structured directory hierarchy
4. **Automated Archival**: Archives old reports based on retention policies
5. **Duplicate Management**: Identifies and merges duplicate or redundant reports
6. **Search Indexing**: Creates searchable metadata index for all reports
7. **Cleanup Optimization**: Removes obsolete files and optimizes storage

## Usage

### Basic Organization
```bash
# Organize all reports with default settings
/workspace:reports

# Quick organization (current reports only)
/organize-reports --quick

# Deep organization (includes archival and compression)
/organize-reports --deep
```

### Advanced Organization Options
```bash
# Custom organization with specific rules
/organize-reports \
  --archive-policy 90days \
  --compress-old \
  --remove-duplicates \
  --create-index

# Organize specific report types
/organize-reports --type validation
/organize-reports --type quality,performance

# Organize by date range
/organize-reports --date-range "2024-01-01..2024-01-31"
/organize-reports --older-than 30days
```

### Dry Run and Preview
```bash
# Preview organization without making changes
/organize-reports --dry-run

# Show detailed analysis before organizing
/organize-reports --analyze

# Interactive mode with confirmation prompts
/organize-reports --interactive
```

## Search and Retrieval

### Built-in Search Commands
```bash
# Search by content
search-reports "validation failed" --type validation

# Search by metadata
search-reports --importance critical --date-range "2024-01-01..2024-01-31"

# Trend analysis
analyze-trends --metric quality_score --period monthly

# Generate summaries
generate-summary --type validation --period "last_30_days"

# Compare reports
compare-reports --type validation --date-range "2023-12..2024-01"
```

### Search Query Examples
```bash
# Find critical security issues
search-reports "security vulnerability" --importance critical --type security

# Track quality improvements
search-reports --type quality --metric score --trend improving

# Find all validation reports from January
search-reports --type validation --date 2024-01

# Generate performance summary
generate-summary --type performance --format markdown --output performance-summary.md
```

## Integration with Other Commands

### With Validation Commands
```bash
# Run validation then organize results
/validate-fullstack
/organize-reports --type validation --quick
```

### With Quality Commands
```bash
# Quality check with report organization
/quality-check
/organize-reports --type quality --create-index
```

### With Learning Commands
```bash
# Analyze patterns and organize findings
/auto-analyze
/organize-reports --deep --extract-metadata
```

## Retention Policies

### Default Retention Rules
```yaml
retention_policies:
  current_reports:
    duration: 30 days
    compression: false
    backup: true

  recent_reports:
    duration: 90 days
    compression: true
    backup: true

  archived_reports:
    duration: 1 year
    compression: true
    backup: true

  critical_reports:
    duration: permanent
    compression: false
    backup: true
    multiple_copies: true
```

### Custom Retention Rules
```bash
# Set custom retention policy
/organize-reports \
  --archive-policy 6months \
  --keep-critical \
  --compress-old \
  --storage-limit 1GB
```

## Best Practices

### Regular Organization
- **Daily**: Quick organization of new reports
- **Weekly**: Deep organization with archival
- **Monthly**: Index rebuilding and optimization
- **Quarterly**: Complete cleanup and retention review

### Storage Management
- Monitor storage usage regularly
- Set appropriate retention policies
- Compress old reports to save space
- Maintain backups of critical reports

### Search Optimization
- Update index regularly
- Use descriptive file names
- Add relevant metadata and tags
- Create executive summaries for quick reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Insufficient Permissions**:
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la .reports/
# Fix permissions
chmod -R 755 .reports/
```

**Storage Space Issues**:
```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h
# Free up space
/organize-reports --compress-old --archive-policy 30days
```

**Search Index Corruption**:
```bash
# Rebuild index
/organize-reports --rebuild-index
```

### Recovery Procedures

**Lost Reports**:
```bash
# Check for moved files
find . -name "*validation*" -type f
# Restore from backup if available
```

**Damaged Index**:
```bash
# Remove corrupted index
rm -f .reports/index/*.json
# Rebuild from scratch
/organize-reports --rebuild-index --deep
```
