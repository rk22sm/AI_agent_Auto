# Recommend Command

Get intelligent recommendations for optimal workflows, skill combinations, and agent delegations based on learned patterns before starting a task.

## How It Works

1. **Task Analysis**: Analyzes your task description to classify type and complexity
2. **Pattern Matching**: Queries pattern database for similar successful tasks
3. **Probability Calculation**: Calculates success probabilities based on historical data
4. **Ranking**: Ranks approaches by expected quality, time, and confidence
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Provides top 3 approaches with detailed trade-offs
6. **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential issues and mitigation strategies

**IMPORTANT**: When delegating this command to the orchestrator agent, the agent MUST present comprehensive recommendations with expected outcomes, confidence levels, alternatives, and risk assessments. Silent completion is not acceptable.

## Usage

```bash
# Get recommendations for a specific task
/monitor:recommend "refactor authentication module"

# Or just invoke for general guidance
/monitor:recommend
```

## What You'll Get

### Best Approach Recommendation
- **Expected Quality Score**: Predicted quality (e.g., 94/100)
- **Estimated Time**: How long it will take (e.g., 12-15 minutes)
- **Confidence Level**: How confident the prediction is (e.g., 92%)
- **Recommended Skills**: Which skills to load and why
- **Recommended Agents**: Which agents to delegate to
- **Based On**: Number of similar successful patterns

### Alternative Approaches
- Comparison of different strategies
- Trade-offs between quality, time, and complexity
- When to use each approach

### Skill Synergy Analysis
- Which skill combinations work best together
- Synergy scores showing complementarity
- Expected quality improvement from combinations

### Agent Delegation Strategy
- Optimal agent workflow
- Sequential vs parallel execution
- Time savings from parallelization

### Quality Prediction
- Predicted quality score with confidence interval
- Key factors influencing the prediction
- Comparison to baseline (without patterns)

### Time Estimation
- Estimated duration with confidence range
- Time breakdown by factors
- Historical comparison with similar tasks

### Risk Assessment
- Overall risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Specific risk factors identified
- Mitigation strategies for each risk
- Adjusted predictions accounting for risks

## Example Output

The orchestrator MUST present the full recommendation report. The example output in this file demonstrates the EXACT format expected. Do NOT summarize - show the complete recommendations:
