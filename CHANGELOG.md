### 🛠️ **Patch Release: Dashboard Browser Fix & System Integration**

This patch release resolves critical dashboard functionality issues and ensures seamless integration of all recently implemented revolutionary features.

#### **🔧 Dashboard Browser Launch Fix**

**Problem Resolved**
- **Duplicate Browser Launch Issue**: Fixed the critical bug where `/monitor:dashboard` was opening two browser windows/tabs instead of one

- **Browser Opening Logic**: Fixed condition `if not args['auto_open_browser']` to `if args['auto_open_browser'] == False` (line 640)
- **Proper Execution Flow**: Ensured single browser launch through proper separation of concerns

**Before Fix**
```
User calls /monitor:dashboard
↓
Orchestrator → dashboard.py (opens browser)
↓
dashboard_launcher.py (opens another browser)
Result: 2 browser windows ❌
```

**After Fix**
```
User calls /monitor:dashboard
↓
Orchestrator → dashboard_launcher.py (opens browser once)
↓
dashboard_launcher.py → dashboard.py --no-browser
Result: 1 browser window ✅
```
